Donate
====================

I have made Maestro Server with my heart, think to solve a real operation IT problem. Its not easy, take time and resources. 

The donation will be user to:

- All pages are hosted on AWS
- Demo service is hosted on AWS, and we would like to use kubernetes environment.
- Use telemetry and monitoring services to improve the system.
- Create new features, implement new providers.
- Maintenance libs, securities flaws, and technical points.


If you could, you can help me, buy me a coffee, together we can keep the project up and create excited new features.
